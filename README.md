Rope dices
==========

**A dice application for Sailfish OS.**

The application makes dice-rolling simple: press a dice button and the
dice value is shown on the screen. There are fixed dice buttons _D4_,
_D6_, _D8_, _D10_, _D12_ and _D20_ as well as a configurable dice button
_Dx_. User can also configure the number of dices being rolled (1–10).
